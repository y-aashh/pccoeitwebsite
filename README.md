This live, mini-project focuses on making a database maintained for management of faculty interaction with the outside world. The database management system uses MySQL at the back-end to store data. The front-end is developed in HTML, CSS Bootstrap and Vue to make an interactive website.
Workshops attended as well as organized by the faculty, conferences attended etc. are managed by the system. The system allows referencing of data from different tables in a database. The final project developed is in the form of a website.
